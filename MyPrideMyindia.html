        <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #808080;">India is my home, it is my nation, it is my pride. August 15 is a paramount day in the historical backdrop of India and it is praised by most of the populace through celebrations and thanksgiving. It was on August 15, 1947, that India was at last granted its autonomy after a long and intense battle from colonization and being slaves to western nations who extricated its excellence and assets. At the stroke of midnight, Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s saint perused out his “Tryst with predetermination” discourse, broadcasting India’s autonomy and for the last time declaring freedom. Jawaharlal Nehru turned into the main Prime Minister of Independent India and these days, as befitting the day, there are festivities and celebrations everywhere throughout the country with the national banner being raised in bombastic and merriment. From the bulwarks of the Red Fort in New Delhi, the Prime Minister conveys his message to the country which highlights the accomplishments and the achievements of the legislature amid the previous year and furthermore pays tribute to flexibility contenders, residents, workmanship, culture, and advance.</p><br>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #808080;">I cherish my nation since India is a country with solidarity in assorted qualities and advance in time, however, the vision without bounds and the recognition of the past. It is a promoter of peace. Peace, particularly through the most profound sense of being, is a simple and remarkable nature of India. Individuals from different countries are getting pulled in towards India to accomplish true serenity and satisfaction as India is a place where there are celebrations. There are numerous attractions to sightseers, for example, celebrations like Diwali, Holi, which don’t have a place with any one group yet is commended by all. The Numerous dialects, and cooking styles one of a kind to India is likely one that is well known the world over. The Tricolor speaks to peace, thriving and renunciation with the Ashoka Chakra being the wheel of the law of Dharma. Today, India is a law based nation, that is, it is by the general population, of the general population, and for the general population.</p><br>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #808080;">India is the biggest majority rule government on the planet in the most genuine importance of “vote based system”. The nation is mainstream, however, amidst the diverse dialects talked, standings and traditions the nation stays joined in its dreams for a superior future. Vacationers can make a trip from Kanyakumari to the Himalayas as an “Indian” and the general population will love and acknowledge you for your identity. Our nation is a major nation, however, there is an extraordinary arrangement that should be finished by every one of us so as to make a superior nation as well as a superior world.</p><br>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #808080;">I am so proud of how far my country has come at the educational level. India has a wide range of qualified and professional engineers.There are many institutes and universities of technology. The Indian youth are knowledgeable and well-educated. Through engineering, my country has become rich and abundant. I love it when I read about India being leading in the engineering field among other countries. Technology in my country has reached its zenith and revolutionized the society. Many Indian engineers are recruited by British companies. Local development has been corroborated by the efforts of our experts. Science and technology have become the backbone of the Indian educational system. Knowledge is the aim of all Indians.</p><br>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #808080;">I should also mention that my country is definitely my pride when it comes to gastronomy. I am fond of the Indian culinary culture. In India, and almost in all Indian restaurants all over the world, you can relish the most delicious dishes. Food tastes great. With all the rich flavors and varieties, I can only boast of being Indian. My favorite dishes are Biryani, Momos, Chole bhature, and Rajma. Indian kitchen has become wide-spread and famous, especially because it is known for its special spices and herbs that render food tasty. It is, relatively, worth mentioning the importance of Indian street food that attracts a wide range of tourists from various countries. You won’t fall in love with it until you taste some of such street delicacies. Aloo Tikki is what I would like to eat in Delhi streets while I am strolling happily.</p><br>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #808080;">The nation of India is all around cherished by its natives. They all have something which they genuinely have pride on. While some said it was the fluctuated culture and legacy, others discussed the magnificence of the nation, while other individuals say that it’s the mass awareness of the general population, as India is famously known as a lively and bubbly nation loaded with grins, shading, and class. In India, there is Unity in assorted qualities. My nation is a place that is known for different societies, legacies, numerous dialects and religions. In spite of the distinctions, our India is joined in its wide and separated differences in individuals, in dialect, and in convictions. The mainstay of the magnificence and tastefulness of the nation is established in every single one of its individuals as the gladly do their obligations and enthusiasm as a feature of this one mother. The general population of this nation, its dazzling societies, its dialects, the awesome views and the great heart of the Indians make us feel glad that we are conceived in such a delightful land.</p>
