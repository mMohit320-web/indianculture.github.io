             <p style="font-size: 15px;">The Taj Mahal will never lose its charm. Not only is it India's most recognized monument, it's also one of the Seven Wonders of the World. Dating back to 1630, it looms fairytale-like from the banks of the Yamuna River. The Taj Mahal is actually a tomb that contains the body of Mumtaz Mahal -- the wife of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. He had it built as an ode to his love for her. It's made out of marble and took 22 years and 20 000 workers to complete. For most people, a visit to India is incomplete without seeing it.</p>
             <p style="font-size: 15px;">Standing majestically on the banks of River Yamuna, the Taj Mahal is synonymous to love and romance. The name "Taj Mahal" was derived from the name of Shah Jahan's wife, Mumtaz Mahal, and means "Crown Palace". The purity of the white marble, the exquisite ornamentation, precious gemstones used and its picturesque location, all make a visit to the Taj Mahal gain a place amongst the most sought-after tours in the world. However, until you know the love story behind the construction of the Taj Mahal, the beauty of the same would not enliven in your heart and mind and instead would come up as just another beautiful building/monument. It is the love behind this outstanding monument that has given a life to this monument. Come and explore the visceral charisma that it emanates</p>

             <p style="font-size: 15px;">Agra Fort, while undoubtedly overshadowed by the Taj Mahal, is one of the finest Mughal forts in India. It was originally a brick fort that was held by a clan of Rajputs. However, it was subsequently captured by the Mughals and rebuilt by Emperor Akbar, who decided to shift his capital there in 1558. There are many buildings to see inside the Fort, including mosques, public and private audience halls, palaces, towers, and courtyards. Another attraction is the evening sound and light show that recreates the Fort's history.</p>
             <p style="font-size: 15px;">Agra Fort is known for its rich history. The fort has been owned by many emperors and rulers in the past, undergoing many changes in its appearance. It all began in the year 1526 when the first battle of Panipat was fought between Babur and Ibrahim Lodi of the Lodi dynasty. When Babur defeated Ibrahim Lodi, he made the fort and the palace of Ibrahim Lodi as his home. He then modified the fort by building a huge step well (baoli) inside. The fort soon became an important monument to the Mughals. In fact, Babur’s successor, Humayun’s coronation took place at the fort in the year 1530.</p>

             <p style="font-size: 15px;">One of Delhi's top attractions, Qutab Minar is the tallest brick minaret in the world and is an incredible example of early Indo–Islamic architecture. It's widely believed that it dates back to the 13th century, when Qutab-Ud-Din-Aibak (founder of the Delhi Sultanate) is said to have started constructing it. However, a great deal of controversy surrounds its origin and purpose. It may in fact have originally been a Hindu tower. The tower has five distinct stories and a height of 72.5 meters (238 feet). There are also a number of other historic monuments on the site</p>
             <p style="font-size: 15px;">Qutb ud-Din Aibak, the founder of the Turkish rule in north-western India and also of the Mamluk Dynasty in Delhi commissioned the construction of this monument in 1192 AD. Aibak dedicated the minaret to the Muslim Sufi mystic, saint and scholar of the Chishti Order, Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki. Different beliefs surround the origin of the minaret. While some sources believe it was constructed as a tower of victory marking the beginning of Muslim dominion in India, some others say it served the muezzins who called the faithful to prayer from the minaret. Uncertainty hovers around naming of the tower with some suggesting it was named after the Sufi saint, Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki while others believe it was named after Aibak himself.</p>

             <p style="font-size: 15px;">If you think Humayun's Tomb looks a bit like the Taj Mahal, that's because it was the inspiration for the Taj Mahal's creation. The tomb was built in 1570, and houses the body of the second Mughal emperor, Humayun. It was the first of this type of Mughal architecture to be built in India, and the Mughal rulers followed it up with an extensive period of construction all over the country. The tomb is part of a greater complex that's set among beautiful gardens.</p>
             <p style="font-size: 15px;">The architecture of the tomb is strongly influenced by Persian architecture. The architect of the building Mirak Mirza Ghiyas himself was of Persian origin. Ghiyas constructed the tomb in the center of a Persian-style chaharbagh garden (translated from Farsi - four gardens) with quadrilateral form. The garden, divided in four main parts by walkways or flowing water is created to resemble the paradise garden described in the Quran. These four main parts on their turn are separated by channels to 36 parts.</p>

             <p style="font-size: 15px;">A city that was once the proud capital of the Mughal Empire in the 16th century, Fatehpur Sikri now stands deserted as a well preserved ghost town. It was abandoned by its occupants after only 15 years due to insufficient water supply. The most convenient way to visit Fatehpur Sikri is on a day trip from Agra</p>
             <p style="font-size: 15px;">“ This is Agra madam, “ said my driver with a shrug as he sped past on the highway while we were chased literally by a group of men shouting some expletives. It was not an incident of road rage. A moment ago, a group of men had literally flung themselves on the car as our driver deftly swerved to the left, avoiding them and averting an accident at the same time.  For a moment, we had no idea what hit us. But our driver remained calm and laughed, “Be prepared for more drama. ” We were driving  towards Mughal Emperor Akbar’s erstwhile capital city, Fatehpur Sikri and I learnt that these “highway men” were unauthorised guides who accosted tourists on the road . They are extremely aggressive and my driver warned me to be careful as we explored places to visit in Fatehpur Sikri.</p>

             <p style="font-size: 15px;">Delhi's most famous monument, the Red Fort stands as a powerful reminder of the Mughal emperors who ruled India. Its walls, which stretch for over 2 kilometers (1.2 miles), were built in 1638 to keep out invaders. However, they failed to stop the fort being captured by the Sikhs and the British. The Red Fort has withstood the turbulent trials and tribulations of time—and attack—to be the setting of some of India's most important historical events that shaped the country. The fort's Old Delhi location, opposite Chandni Chowk, is fascinating as well. A sound and light show is held there in the evenings.</p>
             <p style="font-size: 15px;">After 16th century battle of Panipat, Babur won the region and stayed in this fort. He built a step well in it. Later, his son was defeated by Suri and the fort was under their control for 15 years after which Humayun, Babur’s son recaptured it. In earlier days, this fort was called as the brick fort of Badalgarh. It was in ruined condition when Akbar came to throne. He rebuilt it with red sandstones from Rajasthan. 40,000 workers toiled for eight years to complete the fort in 1573. When Shah Jahan took the crown, he re-designed it to the structure that we know today. He used marbles to redesign the fort.</p>

             <p style="font-size: 15px;">The Golden Temple, located in the city of Amritsar in the state of Punjab,is a place of great beauty and sublime peacefulness. Originally a small lake in the midst of a quiet forest, the site has been a meditation retreat for wandering mendicants and sages since deep antiquity. The Buddha is known to have spent time at this place in contemplation. Two thousand years after Buddha's time, another philosopher-saint came to live and meditate by the peaceful lake. This was Guru Nanak (1469-1539), the founder of the Sikh religion. After the passing away of Guru Nanak, his disciples continued to frequent the site; over the centuries it became the primary sacred shrine of the Sikhs. The lake was enlarged and structurally contained during the leadership of the fourth Sikh Guru (Ram Dass, 1574-1581), and during the leadership of the fifth Guru (Arjan, 1581-1606), the Hari Mandir, or Temple of God was built. From the early 1600s to the mid 1700s the sixth through tenth Sikh Gurus were constantly involved in defending both their religion and their temple against Muslim armies. </p>
             <p style="font-size: 15px;">Amritsar, the original name of first the ancient lake, then the temple complex, and still later the surrounding city, means "pool of ambrosial nectar." Looking deeply into the origins of this word amrit, we find that it indicates a drink of the gods, a rare and magical substance that catalyzes euphoric states of consciousness and spiritual enlightenment. With this word we have a very clear example of the spirit, power, or energetic character of a particular place becoming encoded as an ancient geographical place name. The myth is not just a fairy tale. It reveals itself as a coded metaphor if we have the knowledge to read the code: The waters of Amritsar flowing into the lake of the Hari Mandir were long ago - and remain today - a bringer of peacefulness.</p>

             <p style="font-size: 15px;">Sai Baba is said to have been born in 1838. Details of his birth, family, and early years seem unclear. He started to live in Shirdi from 1858. In his early years, Sai Baba lived off the alms that kind women and merchants in the village gave him. He initially had to endure much hostility as most of the people in Shirdi were Hindus and his appearance was indicative of being a Sufi Muslim.</p>
             <p style="font-size: 15px;">It is at this time that Sai Baba of Shirdi is said to have manifested many miracles most of them involving healing of the sickly. Cholera, leprosy, and the plague were rampant at the time with no adequate cure. Sai Baba administered to the sick and cured them quickly. As his following started to increase, the village became a place where devotees could always find food and shelter. Rich devotees contributed towards building rest houses and distribution of food.Sai Baba lived in a small mosque in Shirdi till his demise in 1918. He spoke in parables and always encouraged the listeners to seek out God in all living beings. His story was written and songs sung in his praise even during his lifetime. Sai Baba’s essential simplicity remained his mystique through his life.</p>
