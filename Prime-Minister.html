             <p style="font-size: 15px;">Since independence India has seen 14 full-time Prime Ministers (at the time of updating this post – as on October 25th, 2014) and 15 in all. Pt Jawaharlal Nehru of the Indian National Congress was the first Prime Minister of free India. At present the office is headed by Narendra Modi of the BJP (the 14th full-time PM as in 2014) last vacated by Dr. Manmohan Singh of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA).</p>
            <p style="font-size: 15px;">List of Prime Ministers (PM) given by different political parties in India in the chronological order :</p>

            <h2 style="color: #4cff00; font-family: bold;">Jawaharlal Nehru</h2>
                 <img src="Images/pm1.jpg" class="col-md-3" alt="Jawaharlal Nehru" width="100%" height="auto">
                 <div class="col-md-9">

                 <p style="font-size: 15px;">Jawaharlal Nehru is the first Prime Minister of independent India and played a significant role in shaping modern India by imparting modern values and thinking. He was a social reformer and one of his major work towards society was the reform of the ancient Hindu civil code. It permitted Hindu widow to enjoy equal right with men as far as property and inheritance was concerned.</p>
                 <p style="font-size: 15px;">An influential leader in the Indian independence movement and political heir of Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru became the nation’s first prime minister in 1947. Although faced with the challenge of uniting a vast population diverse in culture, language and religion, he successfully established various economic, social and educational reforms that earned him the respect and admiration of millions of Indians. His policies of non-alignment and Panchscheel—principles of peaceful coexistence—guided India’s international relations until the outbreak of the Sino-Indian War in 1962, which contributed to his declining health and subsequent death in 1964, ending his 17-years in office. His daughter, Indira Gandhi, and grandson, Rajiv Gandhi, later served as prime ministers.</p>

He popularized the slogan ‘Jai Jawan Jai Kisan’, recognizing the need for self-sustenance and self-reliance as the pillars to build a strong nation. He was a man of exceptional will power that was belied by his small frail stature and soft-spoken manner. He wished to be remembered by his work rather than well-rehearsed speeches proclaiming lofty promises.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 15px;">Upon the death of Indira Gandhi in 1984, her son and successor as prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi, appointed Singh minister of finance. In that post Singh’s efforts to reduce governmental regulation of business and to prosecute tax fraud attracted widespread praise. Singh was transferred to the post of minister of defense in January 1987, but he resigned from Gandhi’s cabinet later that year, after his investigations of arms-procurement fraud were squelched. Soon afterward Singh resigned from the government altogether and left Gandhi’s Congress (I) Party.</p>
